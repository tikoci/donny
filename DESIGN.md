# donny — Design

## Layers

```text
src/
  lib/
    nova.ts        — Nova Message TLV codec (encode + decode)
    db.ts          — DudeDB: SQLite access via bun:sqlite
    normalize.ts   — dude.db → relational SQLite transform (schema + writer)
    denormalize.ts — relational SQLite → dude.db reverse transform
    types.ts       — Domain types shared across lib and cli
  cli/
    index.ts     — Command router (info, list, export, add, wizard)
    wizard.ts    — Interactive @clack/prompts wizard
    format.ts    — Table/CSV/JSON output helpers
  index.ts       — Public barrel export
```

`src/lib/` is a pure library. It never imports from `src/cli/`, never calls `process.exit()`, and has no terminal I/O.

`src/cli/` wraps the library. It owns terminal output and exit codes.

`src/index.ts` re-exports the public surface: `DudeDB`, all Nova codec functions and types, domain types, and the normalize/denormalize APIs (`normalize`, `normalizeToFile`, `NORMALIZED_SCHEMA_SQL`, `denormalize`, `denormalizeToFile`, `DUDE_DB_SCHEMA_SQL`).

## Normalized SQLite Export

`src/lib/normalize.ts` walks every `DudeDB` accessor plus on-the-fly raw blob scans for object types not yet exposed (snmp_profiles, notifications, tools, data_sources, file_assets, map_elements, topology_links) and writes a fully relational SQLite database with foreign keys, indexes, and convenience views. The DDL lives in a single `NORMALIZED_SCHEMA_SQL` string at the top of `normalize.ts` — when changing it, also update `docs/normalized-schema.md` and bump `_meta.schema_version` if the change is breaking. See `docs/normalized-schema.md` for the user-facing schema reference and sample queries.

The normalized DB also embeds an internal `_raw_objs (id, obj BLOB)` mirror of the source `objs` table. `src/lib/denormalize.ts` is now encoder-first with raw fallback: unedited modeled rows reuse `_raw_objs` verbatim, while `_dirty=1` rows and user-added rows are re-encoded from normalized columns. This preserves SHA-1 identity for untouched rows while making the normalized DB editable. `_raw_objs` remains internal infrastructure; query through the normalized tables/views.

## Storage: dude.db

The Dude stores all configuration in a SQLite database with three key tables:

- `objs` — one row per monitored object (device, probe, map, etc.). The `obj` column holds a Nova Message binary blob.
- `obj_links` — topology edges (from/to obj ids).
- `chart_values_raw`, `chart_values_10min`, `chart_values_2hour`, `chart_values_1day` — time-series metrics.

`DudeDB` reads and writes `objs` directly. Edges and metrics are read-only in this version.

## Nova Message (nv::message)

The binary serialization format used throughout RouterOS IPC, WinBox, and dude.db. Each object blob is a self-contained TLV sequence.

**Magic**: `4D 32 01 00 FF 88 01 00` (8 bytes)

The magic is structured, not opaque: `4D 32` = 2-byte magic marker, followed by a full `DataFormat` field (`tag=0x0001, marker=0xFF, tcode=0x88`) with a 1-element u32 array whose value identifies the object type (e.g. `0x03`=ServerConfig, `0x0F`=Device, `0x18`=Notification). Both ends of a decode reach offset 12 before reading object fields — `donny` treats bytes 2–7 as part of the magic constant and discards them along with the u32 at offset 8.

**Structure**:

1. Magic (8 bytes)
2. Section-1 field count (u32 LE)
3. Section-1 fields (the "standard" fields for this object type)
4. Continuation fields — separated by `tag=0x0001, marker=0xFE, tcode=0x08` (self_id); NAME is always last

**Field header**: `tag (u16 LE) + marker (u8) + tcode (u8)`

Markers: `0x10` standard, `0x11` compact (always 1 byte), `0xFE` alternate standard.

Type codes:

| tcode | type | payload bytes |
|-------|------|---------------|
| `0x00` | bool_false | 0 |
| `0x01` | bool_true | 0 |
| `0x08` | u32 | 4 |
| `0x09` | u8 | 1 |
| `0x10` | u64 | 8 |
| `0x18` | bytes_16 | fixed 16 (IPv6 address fields, e.g. notification mail server) |
| `0x20` | bytes_4 | fixed 4 (rare fixed-width fields) |
| `0x21` | str | 1-byte len prefix + bytes |
| `0x31` | bytes | 1-byte len prefix + bytes |
| `0x88` | u32_array | 2-byte count + count×4 bytes |
| `0xA0` | compound / string array | 2-byte count + nested fields, or count + u16-length strings for known string-array tags such as device DNS names |

## Object Classification by Tag Range

The leading tag in the section-1 fields identifies the object type. If the first
field is `SELF_ID` (`0x0001`), look at the next type-specific tag to classify.

| Range | Object type | Key tags / notes |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| `0x07D0–0x07DF` | Chart / Panel element | `0x07D0`=type str ("Chart Line"\|"Panel Element"), `0x07D1`=enabled bool |
| `0x1000–0x101F` | Server state metadata | `0x1001`=root_id_list, `0x1015`=timestamp_array, `0x0FEF`=color palette — one per db |
| `0x1770–0x177F` | Network scanner config / Syslog rule | boolean auto-discovery flags; syslog rule objects start at `0x1770` — one scanner config per db |

| `0x3E80–0x3E9B` | Notification | `0x3E9A` = IPv6 mail server address (tcode `0x18`, 16 bytes; all-zero = not configured); `0x3E9B` = mail server DNS name (str; empty = not configured) |

## export.dude Format

The Dude's built-in backup is a gzip-compressed tar archive containing a single `dude.db` SQLite file:

- **Detection**: bytes 0–1 are `0x1F 0x8B` (gzip magic).
- **Structure**: After `Bun.gunzipSync()`, the result is a standard 512-byte POSIX tar block. The file size is an octal string at offset 124 (12 bytes, null-terminated). The SQLite file data starts at byte 512.
- **Opening**: `DudeDB.openAuto(path)` detects the magic, decompresses, extracts the SQLite payload to a temp file (`mkdtempSync`), opens it, and deletes it on `db.close()`.

## Builtin Objects (Clean Database)

A freshly initialised Dude database (`clean.db` / `clean.export`) contains 224 objects — all builtin, no user data:

| Type | Count | ID range |
|------|-------|----------|
| Settings | 1 | 10000 |
| Probe templates | 27 | 10159–10190 (ping=10159, disk=10190) |
| Device types | 17 | 10191–10207 (MikroTik Device=10191, Some Device=10207) |
| Link types | 8 | 10208–10215 (10g ethernet=10208, some link=10215) |
| Syslog rule | 1 | 10221 (name="(default)", enabled, action=notify) |
| Assets | 142 | built-in icons and fonts |
| Notes | 5 | built-in welcome notes |
| Notifications | 5 | built-in alerts |
| SNMP profiles | 3 | built-in community strings |
| Tools | 12 | built-in ping/traceroute/etc tools |
| Chart items | 2 | built-in chart layouts |
| Open panels | 1 | built-in panel definition |

`clean.db` and `clean.export` are committed to the repo (gitignore has `!clean.db` / `!clean.export` exceptions). They contain no PII and are safe to share. Use them in tests to validate both the SQLite and gzip/tar code paths.

IPv4 addresses are stored as u32 little-endian: `a | (b<<8) | (c<<16) | (d<<24)`. Sentinel `0xFFFFFFFF` means no address (DNS-mode device). `ipv4FromU32` / `ipv4ToU32` handle conversion.

## DNS-mode Devices

Devices with a hostname instead of an IP address have no entry in tag `0x1F40` (or an empty array). RouterOS 7.21.4 CHR with the Dude package confirms tag `0x1F41` is `Device_DnsNames` encoded as a string array; a CLI-created DNS device stores this as an empty array and carries the hostname in the `NAME` field. Tag `0x1F42` is `Device_Lookup`, not a DNS-mode flag; the normalized `dns_mode` column is derived from the absence of an IPv4 address.

## addDevice Transaction

`DudeDB.addDevice()` writes three objects in a single SQLite transaction:

1. **Device** blob (tags `0x1F40–0x1F4x`) with IP/DNS, credentials, MAC placeholder
2. **Service** blob (tags `0xBF68–0xBF71`) linked to the device
3. **ProbeConfig** blob (tags `0x2EE0–0x2EF4`) linking device → service → probe type

IDs are allocated by scanning the current max id in `objs` and incrementing. The new objects are invisible to The Dude server until it is restarted.

## Key Design Decisions

- **bun:sqlite** — built-in, no external dep. BLOBs arrive as `Uint8Array`.
- **DataView cursor** over `Buffer` — clean u16/u32/u64 reads with bounds checking.
- **NovaWriter** collects fields in an array and serializes once — avoids incremental buffer resizing.
- **Credentials in cleartext** — dude.db stores RouterOS username/password unencrypted. `DudeDB.devices()` includes them by default; callers must handle PII carefully. `*.db` is gitignored.
